*  You can use a labeled break statement to exit an outer loop.

*  You can use a labeled continue statement to skip the iteration of the outer loop

You can use a labeled break statement to exit an outer loop. Here’s an example:

	String[] programmers = {"Outer", "Inner"};
	outer:
	for (String outer : programmers) {
		for (String inner : programmers) {
			if (inner.equals("Inner")){
				break outer;
				// OR
				continue outer;
			}
			System.out.print(inner + ":");
		}
	}

* You can add labels to a code block defined using braces, {}, all looping
statements (for, enhanced for loop, while, do-while), conditional constructs
(if and switch statements), expressions and assignments, return statements, try
blocks, and throws statements.

*  You can’t add labels to declarations of variables.
