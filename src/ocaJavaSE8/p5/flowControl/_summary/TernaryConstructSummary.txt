* You can use a ternary operator ?: to define a compact if-else construct to
assign value to a variable depending on a boolean expression.

* The parentheses enclosing a boolean expression are optimal for better
readability. The code will work without them.

* You can assign a literal value or an expression to a variable using a ternary
operator.

* A method that returns a value can be used to initialize a variable in a ternary
construct.

NB! * If the expression used to evaluate a ternary operator doesn't return a
boolean or Boolean value, the code won't compile.

* All three parts of a ternary operator are mandatory.

NB! * The value returned by a ternary operator must be assign to a variable, or
the code won't compile.

* Because a ternary operator must return values, which are assigned to a variable,
it can't include code blocks.

NB! * A method that doesn't return a value can't be used to initialize variables in
a ternary construct.

* The value returned by a ternary construct must be compatible with a variable
type to which the value is being assigned.

* Ternary operators can be nested to any level.
