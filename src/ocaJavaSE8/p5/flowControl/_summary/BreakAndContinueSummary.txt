*  The break statement is used to exit—or break out of—the for, for-each, do,
and do-while loops and the switch construct.

*  The continue statement is used to skip the remaining steps in the current
iteration and start with the next loop iteration. The continue statement works
with the for, for-each, do, and do-while loops and the switch construct.

*  When you use the break statement with nested loops, it exits the inner loop.

*  When you use the continue statement with nested loops, it exits the current
iteration of the inner loop.

NB! * A break statement with no label attempts to transfer control to the innermost
enclosing {switch, while, do, or for} statement; this statement, which is called
the break target, then immediately completes normally.

NB! If no switch, while, do, or for statement encloses the break statement,
a compile-time error occurs.
