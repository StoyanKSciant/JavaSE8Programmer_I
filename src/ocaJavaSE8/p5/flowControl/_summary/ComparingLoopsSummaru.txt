NB! * if the compiler finds unreachable code at compilation time, the code won’t
 compile.

* Both the do-while and while loops execute a set of statements until the termination
condition evaluates to false. The only difference between these two
statements is that the do-while loop executes the code at least once, even if the
condition evaluates to false.

*  The regular for loop, though cumbersome to use, is much more powerful than
the enhanced for loop.

*  The enhanced for loop can’t be used to initialize an array and modify its elements.
The enhanced for loop can’t be used to delete or remove the elements
of a collection.

*  The enhanced for loop can’t be used to iterate over multiple collections or
arrays in the same loop.

*  You should try to use a for loop when you know the number of iterations—for
example, iterating through a collection or an array, or executing a loop for a
fixed number of times, say to “ping” a server five times.

*  You should try to use a do-while or a while loop when you don’t know the
number of iterations beforehand and the number of iterations depends on a
condition being true—for example, accepting passport renewal applications
until all applicants have been attended to.
