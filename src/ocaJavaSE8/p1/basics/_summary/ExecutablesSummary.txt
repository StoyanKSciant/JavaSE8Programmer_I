* An executable Java class is a class that, when handed over to the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM), starts its execution at a particular point in the class. This
point of execution is the main method.

* For a class to be executable, the class should define a main method with the
signature public static void main(String args[]) or public static void
main(String... args). The positions of static and public can be interchanged,
and the method parameter can use any valid name.

* A class can define multiple methods with the name main, provided that the
signature of these methods doesn’t match the signature of the main method
defined in the previous point. These overloaded versions aren’t considered the
main method.

* The main method accepts an array of type String containing the method
parameters passed to it by the JVM.

* The keyword java and the name of the class aren’t passed on as command
parameters to the main method.
