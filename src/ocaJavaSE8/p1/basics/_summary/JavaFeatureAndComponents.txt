* Object orientation Java emulates real-life object definition and behavior. It uses
classes, interfaces, or enums to define all its code.

* Abstraction Java lets you abstract objects and include only the required properties
and behavior in yout code.

* Encapsulation The state or the fileds of a class are protected from unwanted
access and manipulation.

* Inheritance Java enables ins classes to inherit other classes and implement interfaces.
The interfaces can inherit other interfaces.

* Polymorphism Java enables its classes to exhibit multiple behaviors for the same
methods calls.

* Type safety In java, you must declare a variable with its data type before you cam
use it.

* Automatic memory management Java uses garbage

* Multithreading and concurrency = Java defines classes and interfaces to enable
developers to develop multithreaded code.

* Java isn't single-threaded language.
