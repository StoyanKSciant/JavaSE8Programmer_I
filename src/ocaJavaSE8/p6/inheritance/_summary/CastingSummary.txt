* Casting is the process of forcefully making a variable behave as a variable
of another type.

Use casting to access some of the members of derived class, which aren't
explicitly available, by using the reference variable of the base type or
the implemented interface.

((HRExecutive) interviewer).specialization = new String[] {"Staffing"}

The parentheses that surround the whole (HRExecutive)interviewer token
are required to bypass the Java operator precedence rules, according to
which the "casting" operator has lower priority then the "." operator
