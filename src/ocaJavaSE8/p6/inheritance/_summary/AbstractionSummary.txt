* It isn’t mandatory for an abstract class to define an abstract method. It may
or may not define any abstract methods. But if an abstract base class defines
one or more abstract methods, the class must be marked as abstract and the
abstract methods must be implemented in all its derived classes.

* If a derived class doesn’t implement all the abstract methods defined by its
base class, then it also needs to be an abstract class.

* You can never create objects of an abstract class.

* A base class can be defined as an abstract class, even if it doesn’t define
any abstract methods.

NB! * A derived class should implement all the abstract methods of its base
class. If it doesn’t, it must be defined as an abstract derived class.

* You can use variables of an abstract base class to refer to objects of its
derived class
