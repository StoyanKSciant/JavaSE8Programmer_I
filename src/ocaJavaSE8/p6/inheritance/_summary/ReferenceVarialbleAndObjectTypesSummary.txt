* With inheritance, you can also refer to an object of a derived class using a
variable of a base class or interface.

* An object of a base class can’t be referred to using a reference variable of
its derived class.

NB! * When an object is referred to by a reference variable of a base class, the
reference variable can only access the variables and members that are defined
in the base class.

NB! * When an object is referred to by a reference variable of an interface
implemented by a class, the reference variable can access only the variables
and methods defined in the interface.

* You may need to access an object of a derived class using a reference variable
of the base class to group and use all the classes with common parent classes
or interfaces.
