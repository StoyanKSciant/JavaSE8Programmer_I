* Overridden methods are defined by classes and interfaces that share inheritance
relationships.

* The name of the overridden method must be the same in both the base class
and the derived class.

* The argument list passed to the overridden method must be the same in both
the base class and derived class.

NB! * The return type of an overriding method in the derived class can be the
same, or a subclass of the return type of the overridden method in the base class.
When the overriding method returns a subclass of the return type of the overridden
method, it is known as a covariant return type.

* An overridden method defined in the base class can be an abstract method or
a non-abstract method.

* Access modifiers for an overriding method can be the same or less restrictive
than the method being overridden, but they can’t be more restrictive
