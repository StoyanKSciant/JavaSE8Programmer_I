* Overloaded method must change the argument list.

* Overloaded method may change the return type.

* Overloaded method may throw new or broader exceptions.

* Overloaded method may change the access modifier both ways.

* You can define multiple parameters for a method.

* The method parameter can be a primitive type or object.

* The method"s parameters are separated by commas.

* Static methods CAN be overloaded.

* Each method parameter is preceded by the name of its type. Each method
parameter must have an explicit type declared with its name. You can't declare
the type once and then list the parameters separated by commas, as you can
for variables.

* For a method that returns a value, the return statement must be followed
immediately by a value.

* For a method that doesn't return a value (return type is void), the return
statement must not be followed by a return value.

* If the compiler determines that a return statement isn't the last statement to
execute in a method, the method will fail to compile.

* Overloaded methods must have method parameters different from one another.

* Overloaded methods may or may not define a different return type.

* Overloaded methods may or may not define different access levels.

* Overloaded methods can't be defined by only changing their return type or
access modifiers or both.

NB! * The Overloaded method MUST declare signature with the same exceptions or
subclasses of the same exceptions (getting more specific at the exception
handling) that have been described in the super method signature.
