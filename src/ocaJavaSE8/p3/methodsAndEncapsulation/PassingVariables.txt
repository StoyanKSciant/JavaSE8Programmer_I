* When you pass a primitive variable to a method, its value remains the same after
the execution of the method. This doesn’t change, regardless of whether the
method reassigns the primitive to another variable or modifies it.

* When you pass an object to a method, the method can modify the object’s state
by executing its methods. In this case, the modified state of the object is reflected
in the calling method.
