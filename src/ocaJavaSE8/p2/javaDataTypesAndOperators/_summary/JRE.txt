Java byte code is basically just a set of instructions that are intepreted by a
virtual machine and is independent of the actual machine and OS i.e. the
platform. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the virtual machine that interprets
the given byte code and converts it into the actual platform understandable
instructions. Therefore, all you need to run the byte code is the virtual
machine (JRE) for that specific platform on which you want to run it.

Since the byte code itself is platform independent, you can compile your java
code on any platform because no matter where you compile your code, the same
byte code will be produced. Therefore, you don't need a java compiler for a
particular platform. You just need the JRE for that platform. Oracle provides
JRE for several platforms including Windows and Unix.

SO COMPILE CODE IS THE SAME IN EVERY HARDWARE
DIFFERENT JRE RUN THAT SAME COMPILE CODE ON ALL SUPPORTED HARDWARE
