*ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and IndexOutOfBoundsException are runtime
exceptions, which share an IS-A relationship. IndexOutOfBoundsException is
sub-classed by ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

* ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when a piece of code tries to access
an array out of its bounds (either an array is accessed at a position less than
0 or at a position greater than or equal to its length).

* IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when a piece of code tries to access a
list, like an ArrayList, using an illegal index.

* NOTE: When you try to access an invalid array position, ArrayIndexOutOf-
BoundsException is thrown. When you try to access an invalid ArrayList
position, IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
