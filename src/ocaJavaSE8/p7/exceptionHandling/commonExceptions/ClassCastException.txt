}

* ClassCastException is thrown when an object fails an IS-A test with the
class type to which it’s being cast. In the preceding example, class Ink is
the base class for classes ColorInk and BlackInk. The JVM throws a
ClassCastException in the previous case because the line of code in bold
tries to explicitly cast an object of ColorInk to BlackInk.

* Note that this line of code avoided the compilation error because the variable
inks defines an ArrayList of type Ink, which is capable of storing objects of
type Ink and all its subclasses.
