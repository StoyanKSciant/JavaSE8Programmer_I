* Exceptions are divided into three categories: checked exceptions, runtime (or
unchecked exceptions), and errors. These three categories share IS-A
relationships (inheritance).

* Subclasses of the class java.lang.RuntimeException are categorized as runtime
exceptions.

* Subclasses of the class java.lang.Error are categorized as errors.

* Subclasses of the class java.lang.Exception are categorized as checked
exceptions if they are not subclasses of class java.lang.Runtime.

* The class java.lang.RuntimeException is a subclass of the class
java.lang.Exception.

* The class java.lang.Exception is a subclass of the class java.lang.Throwable.

* The class java.lang.Error is also a subclass of the class java.lang.Throwable.

* The class java.lang.Throwable inherits the class java.lang.Object.
