* Runtime exceptions (also known as unchecked exceptions) is a representation of
a programming error. These occur from inappropriate use of another piece of code.
For example, NullPointer-Exception.

* A runtime exception is a subclass of java.lang.RuntimeException.

NB! * A runtime exception may not be a part of the method signature, even if a
method may throw it.

* A runtime exception may not necessarily be caught by a try-catch block.
