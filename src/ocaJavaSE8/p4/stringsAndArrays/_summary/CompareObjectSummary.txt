* Any Java class can define a set of rules to determine whether two objects
should be considered equal.

NB! * The default implementation of the equals() method only compares whether
two object variables refer to the same object.

* Because instance variables are used to store the state of an object, it’s
common to compare the values of the instance variables to determine whether two
objects should be considered equal.

* When you override the equals() method in your class, make sure that you use
the correct method signature for the equals method.

NB! * The Java API defines a contract for the equals method, which should be
taken care of when you implement the method in any of your classes.
According to the contract of the method equals, if a null value is passed to it,
the method equals should return false.

* If the equals() method modifies the value of any of the instance variables of
the method parameter passed to it, or of the object on which it is called, it
will violate the contract.
