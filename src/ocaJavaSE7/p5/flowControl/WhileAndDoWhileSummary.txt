* A while loop is used to keep executing a set of statements until the condition
that it uses evaluates to false. This loop checks the condition before it starts the
execution of the statement.

* A do-while loop is used to keep executing a set of statements until the condition
that it uses evaluates to false. This loop checks the condition before it starts the
execution of the statement.

* The levels of nested do-while and while loops have no limitations.

* Both do-while and while loops can define either a single line of code or a code block
to execute. The latter is defined by using curly braces{}.
