* A switch statement is used to compare the value of a variable with multiple predefined
values.
*  A switch statement accepts arguments of type
	char,
	byte,
	short,
	int, and
	NOTE: doesn’t accept long primitive data type argument.
String. It also accepts arguments of wrapper classes:
Character,
Byte,
Short,
Integer,
and Enum.

*  A switch statement can be compared with multiple related if-else-if-else
constructs.

*  You can pass an expression as an argument to a switch statement, as long as the
type of the expression is one of the acceptable data types.

*  The case value must be a compile-time constant, that is, the
value should be known at the time of code compilation:

*  The case value can’t be the literal value null.

*  The case value can define expressions that use literal values; that is, they can be
evaluated at compile time, as in 7+2.

*  One code block can be defined to execute for multiple case values in a
switch statement.

*  A break statement is used to exit a switch construct once a matching case is
found and the required code statements have executed.

*  In absence of the break statement, control will fall through all the remaining
case values in a switch statement until the first break statement is found, evaluating
the code for the case statements in order.
