* Base class—A class inherited by another class. The class Employee is a base class
for the classes Programmer and Manager in the previous examples.

* Superclass—A base class is also known as a superclass.

* Parent class—A base class is also known as a parent class.

* Derived class—A class that inherits from another class. The classes Programmer
and Manager are derived classes in the previous example.

* Subclass—A derived class is also known as a subclass.

* Extended class—A derived class is also known as an extended class.

* Child class—A derived class is also known as a child class.

* IS-A relationship—A relationship shared by base and derived classes. In the previous
examples, a Programmer IS-A Person. A Manager IS-A Person. Because a
derived class represents a specialized type of a base class, a derived IS-A class is a
kind of base class.

* extends—The keyword used by a class to inherit another class and by an interface
to inherit another interface.

* implements—The keyword used by a class to implement an interface (interfaces
are covered in the next section).

* Casting is the process of forcefully making a variable behave as a variable of another
type. If a class shares an IS-A or inheritance relationship with another class or interface,
their variables can be cast to each other’s type.

* can’t use super in static method
