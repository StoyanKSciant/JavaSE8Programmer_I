* The ExceptionInInitializerError error is typically thrown by the JVM when a
static initializer in your code throws any type of RuntimeException

* Runtime exceptions arising from any of the followin will throw this error:
1. Execution of an anonymous static block
2. Initialization of a static variable
3. Execution of a static method (called from either of the previous two items)


ExceptionInInitializerError caused by NumberFormatException:
public class DemoExceptionInInitializerError {
	static {
		int num = Integer.parseInt("sd", 16);
	}
}


ExceptionInInitializerError caused by java.lang.NullPointerException
public class DemoExceptionInInitializerError1 {
	static String name = null;
	static int nameLength = name.length();
}

ExceptionInInitializerError caused by MyException
public class DemoExceptionInInitializerError2 {
	static String name = getName();
	static String getName() {
		throw new MyException();
	}
}

* ExceptionInInitializerError can be caused by an object of RuntimeException only.
It can’t occur as the result of an error or checked exception thrown by the static
initialization block.
