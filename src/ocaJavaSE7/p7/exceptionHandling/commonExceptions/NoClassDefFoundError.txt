* NoClassDefFoundError is thrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader
instance tries to load in the definition of a class (as part of a normal
method call or as part of creating a new instance using the new expression)
and no definition of the class could be found.

* Don’t confuse the exception thrown by Class.forName(), used to load the
class, and NoClassDefFoundError thrown by the JVM. Class.forName() throws
ClassNotFoundException.
