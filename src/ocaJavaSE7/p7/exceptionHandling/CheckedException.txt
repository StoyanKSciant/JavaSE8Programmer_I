* A checked exception is an unacceptable condition foreseen by the author of a
method but outside the immediate control of the code. For example, FileNot-
FoundException

* Checked exception is a subclass of class java.lang.Exception, but it’s not a
subclass of java.lang.RuntimeException. It’s interesting to note, however,
that the class java.lang.RuntimeException itself is a subclass of the class
java.lang.Exception.

* Trying to execute a method that throws a checked exception without handling
the thrown exception causes a compilation error.

* Trying to call a method recursively without defining an exit condition is considered
an exceptional condition.

* If a method uses another method that may throw a checked exception, one of the two
following things should be true:
1. The method should be enclosed within a try-catch block
				or
2. The method should specify this exception to be thrown in its method signature
