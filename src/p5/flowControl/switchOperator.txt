switch accepts:	(Note: no floats)

	-enum


*The value of a case label must be a compile-time constant value; that is, the
value should be known at the time of code compilation:
	int a=10, b=20, c=30;
	switch (a) {
		case b+c: System.out.println(b+c); break;	// not allowed
		case 10*7: System.out.println(10*7512+10); break;	// allowed
	}

*null isn’t allowed as a case label

You can define multiple statements in the update clause, including calls to other
methods. The only limit is that these statements will execute in the order in which
they appear, at the end of all the statements defined in the for block.

	String line = "ab";
	for (int i=0; i < line.length(); ++i, printMethod())	// call other method in statement
	System.out.println(line.charAt(i));
	}
		private static void printMethod() {
		System.out.println("Happy");
	}

*LABELED BREAK STATEMENTS

You can use a labeled break statement to exit an outer loop. Here’s an example:

	String[] programmers = {"Outer", "Inner"};
	outer:
	for (String outer : programmers) {
		for (String inner : programmers) {
			if (inner.equals("Inner")){
				break outer;
				// OR
				continue outer;
			}
			System.out.print(inner + ":");
		}
	}


You can add labels to a code block defined using braces, {}, all looping
statements (for, enhanced for loop, while, do-while), conditional constructs
(if and switch statements), expressions and assignments, return statements,
try blocks, and throws statements.
